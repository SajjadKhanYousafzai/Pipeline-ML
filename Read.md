# Pipeline in Machine Learning

In machine learning, a pipeline is a sequence of data processing steps that are chained together to automate and streamline the machine learning workflow. A pipeline allows you to combine multiple data preprocessing and model training steps into a single object, making it easier to organize and manage your machine learning code.
