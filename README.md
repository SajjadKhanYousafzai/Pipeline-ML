<h2 id="introduction-to-machine-learning">Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. It’s used in a wide range of applications, from email filtering and speech recognition to autonomous driving and predictive analytics.</p>

<h2 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data:</strong> The foundation of machine learning, which includes features (input variables) and labels (output variables).</li>
    <li><strong>Model:</strong> A mathematical representation of the data, which is trained to make predictions or decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Training:</strong> The process of teaching a model to make accurate predictions by feeding it data.</li>
    <li><strong>Testing/Validation:</strong> Evaluating the model's performance on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="types-of-machine-learning">Types of Machine Learning</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Learning from labeled data. The algorithm is trained on a dataset that includes input-output pairs.
        <ul>
            <li>Examples: Classification, Regression.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Learning from unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures.
        <ul>
            <li>Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Learning by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments.
        <ul>
            <li>Examples: Game Playing, Robotics.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="common-algorithms">Common Algorithms</h2>
